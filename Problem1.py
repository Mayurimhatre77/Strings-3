#I implemented a method to convert integers into their English word representation. The numberToWords function first handles the base case where the number is zero. For non-zero numbers, it recursively breaks down the number into chunks of up to 999 (handling hundreds, tens, and units) and processes each chunk accordingly. The num_words and num_words_2 lists provide word mappings for numbers up to 19 and multiples of ten respectively. As the recursion unwinds, it assembles the word representation for each chunk, taking care to append "Thousand", "Million", or "Billion" appropriately. The complexity of this approach is O(log(n)) in time due to the recursive nature of dividing the number, and O(log(n)) in space due to the recursion stack and string operations. This method efficiently manages different scales of numbers by breaking down the problem into manageable parts and recursively constructing the final word representation.
