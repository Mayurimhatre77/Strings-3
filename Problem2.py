#I implemented a class Solution with a method calculate that parses and computes the result from the given string s. The approach uses a stack to handle operators and operands effectively. As I iterate through the string, I accumulate digits to form numbers and process each operator by performing the corresponding arithmetic operation on the stack. The process function handles the arithmetic based on the current operator, updating the stack accordingly. At the end of the iteration, I process the final number and sum up the values in the stack to obtain the result. This approach ensures that multiplication and division are handled immediately with the previous number, adhering to operator precedence rules. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, as each character is processed once. The space complexity is O(n) due to the space required for the stack, which stores intermediate results.

class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        def process(operator, curr_num, stack):
            if operator == '+':
                stack.append(curr_num)
            elif operator == '-':
                stack.append(-curr_num)
            elif operator == '*':
                stack.append(stack.pop() * curr_num)
            elif operator == '/':
                stack.append(int(stack.pop() / curr_num))
        
        operator = '+'
        curr_num = 0
        stack = []

        for elem in s:
            if elem.isdigit():
                curr_num = curr_num*10 + int(elem)
            elif elem in {'+', '-', '*', '/'}:
                process(operator, curr_num, stack)
                operator = elem
                curr_num = 0
        
        process(operator, curr_num, stack)
        return sum(stack)
